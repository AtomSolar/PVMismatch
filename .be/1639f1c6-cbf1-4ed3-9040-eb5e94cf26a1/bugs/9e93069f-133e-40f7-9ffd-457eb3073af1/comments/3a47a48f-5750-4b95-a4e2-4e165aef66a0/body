* Currently setting temperature only changes thermal voltage, which has an
  insignificant effect on IV characteristics. Temperature dependence of the IV
  curve is due to temp dependence of Isat1, Isat2, Rs and Rsh, which each have
  characteristic temperature dependence, e.g. Isat = f(T^3), Rs = f(T)
  and Rsh = f(exp(-T)).
* Also user can only set one temperature, instead of temp of each cell or
  or module.
* Expected outcome is that user set cell temperature correctly affects
  IV curve, according to expected temperature coefficients
