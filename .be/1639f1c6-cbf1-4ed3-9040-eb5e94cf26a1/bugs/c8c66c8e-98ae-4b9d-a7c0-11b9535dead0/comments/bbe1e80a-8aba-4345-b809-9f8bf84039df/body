Irradiance dependence is **not** necessarily the problem. In fact it turns out that the isn't a bug at all! C7 has a **much lower** series resistance. The behavior I was seeing **was** the expected behavior for a standard 1-sun gen C cell; ie its efficiency and fill-factor **should drop!** Lowering the series resistance for C7 increases the efficiency and fill factor to match reality.
